The SNS integration is optional but recommended in order to get those features.\r\n\r\n#### Features:\r\n\r\n+ Email template editor out of the box.\r\n+ Mustache tags enables to use variables in templates.\r\n+ Reusable templates.\r\n+ Reusable email lists.\r\n+ Tracks opens and clics.\r\n+ Tracks Bounces and Complaints (via AWS SNS).\r\n+ Displays reports on:\r\n  + % of deliveries.\r\n  + clicks , opens , bounces, complaints.\r\n  + Detail list off who opens, clicks, bounces & complaints.\r\n\r\n### How to install:\r\n\r\nUse chaskiq as a gem in a rails project.\r\n\r\n+ gem 'chaskiq' in your gemfile and execute bundle install\r\n+ rails generate chaskiq:install (will add an initializer , route & migrations)\r\n+ rake db:migrate\r\n\r\n+ config/initializers/active_job.rb\r\n  ```ActiveJob::Base.queue_adapter = :sidekiq```\r\n\r\n### Secure system:\r\n\r\nyou can use any user system just configue Chaskiq authentication method for controllers.\r\n\r\nassuming you are using device, to protect the admin paths you will use the device's auth method for controllers as is.\r\n\r\nconfig/initializers/chaskiq.rb\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nChaskiq::Config.setup do |config|\r\n  config.authentication_method = :authenticate_user!\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nread more about heroku and vps installs, Amazon integration and more in our wiki page https://github.com/michelson/chaskiq/wiki\r\n\r\n# TODO:\r\n+ api support.\r\n+ search items (lists, campaign , metrics).\r\n+ improve mail editor (support for ).\r\n+ more insighfull reportery.\r\n+ scheduled deliveries via (sidetiq or whenever).\r\n+ send to many lists in one campaign and send to list segments.\r\n\r\nMiguel Michelson Martinez. released under MIT.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
